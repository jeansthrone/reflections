How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	It help me to know very quickly in witch line of the code the error 
	may be.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will allow me to see what have been done before to do it better and
    to and comparete in case of a bug or error came up.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I create them when is just riht and isnt too bit or too small
    Cons: I canÂ´t forget to create them, i can make a mistake and create them too soon which make it harder to find the bug; or too late which make it harder to compare the commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because that give total freedom to the user

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    comparing them with previous versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    they allow me to know that there is a funtion version store somewhere.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To finish the DevOps course.
