When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i´m working with other people in the same project or when i wan´t to show it to someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because in that way i can choose when is the rith time to pull a repository.
