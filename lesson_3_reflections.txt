When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i´m working with other people in the same project or when i wan´t to show it to someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because in that way i can choose when is the rith time to pull a repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks: used to copy files from another GitHub account to your own Github account without downloding in the local machine.

	Clone: used to clone repositories in the local machine, from GitHub or the same local machine.

	Branches: used to create a new version of a repository without afecting the original.
