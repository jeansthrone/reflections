What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It create a new .git file that is hidden and it shows me this: "Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Jean Franco/version-control/reflections/.git/" i need to do it to make anew project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a place where to put files before putting inthe commit for the working directory. It alow us to put several files in the same commit.
